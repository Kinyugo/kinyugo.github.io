  description: >
    Official implementation of the Msanii paper. The paper introduces a novel diffusion
    based model for audio synthesis. It outperforms existing diffusion models in terms of
    fidelity, long-term coherence and efficiency.

    odewel (/əʊdwel/) is a library that can optimize machine learning models for better
    efficiency by loading weights only when needed for computation. This makes
    the models leaner and more nimble, and allows them to run on any hardware,
    regardless of its size or the hardware capabilities.
